            <dd>This recipe is a simple and quick version of making chicken gravy.
                Indian recipes always has a lot of ingredients and spices in it this chicken gravy is one among them.
                Adding the right ingredients in exact proportion makes the dish taste more delicious. This chicken gravy is made without coconut and i can guarantee you that you are gonna love it. 
                Due to its simplicity and easiness my mom prepares this gravy on every Christmas and Easter night before the mass starts so that we can have our second dinner as soon as we come back from church. My favorite combination is this curry with a plate of parotta. Oh my god my mouth is watering thinking of it.</dd>
